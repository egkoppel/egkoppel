### Hi there
I'm a second year engineering student at Cambridge, with a bunch of side programming projects here! I end up creating a few repos per project, which is why most of the links here link to other organisations - almost all the code is written by only me.

My main project at the moment is [popcorn-2](github.com/popcorn-2/popcorn-2), a rewrite (back into Rust, it's a long story) of my earlier C++ attempt ([popcorn-1](github.com/egkoppel/popcorn-1)). It's a microkernel with a general aim of experimenting with how to improve security and a reduction in application permissions (think phone style sandboxing), without reducing UX by a substantial amount. It also has a few other aims like trying to be vaguely UNIX based but impoving all the imo weird bits like having to treat everything as a file and then fudge extras on with `ioctl`, and instead replaces this with a higher level, extensible IDL.

In the past I've also worked on a toy language and compiler ([znoc](github.com/zno-project/znoc)), as well as working at Firefly Racing for a year building various telematics systems (closed source but some photos are on my LinkedIn).

I also (very occasionally) post about other not necessarily programming bits and bobs on my blog at [eliyahu.co.uk].
